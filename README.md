- This called marble diagram
- The horizontal line represents time 
- Circles marbles if you will are data or events that occur over time 
- And remember that pretty much every thing in RXSwift is observable sequence or something that reacts to an observable sequence 
- what RXSWIFt enables you to do is right asynchronous code that is way more streamlined and easier to follow than using the various patterns and apis you may be used to using from the iOS SDk
